<h2>Directions:</h2>
Step 1
Place cauliflower into the bowl of a food processor and blend until finely chopped.
<br>
Step 2
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add carrots, celery, and onion. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add garlic and continue to cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Pour in broth and cauliflower; increase heat to high. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to a simmer and cook until vegetables are tender, 15 to 20 minutes.
<br>
Step 3
Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add flour and cook for 2 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk milk in slowly and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and add Cheddar cheese slowly until completely combined.
<br>
Step 4
Pour broth from cauliflower mixture into an electric blender and puree to your desired consistency. Return to the saucepan. Pour cheese sauce into soup and stir well to combine.
<br>
Step 5
Serve in bowls and garnish with additional Cheddar cheese, if desired.
